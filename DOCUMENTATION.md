## Systems

### Mining System

The mining system provides a complete resource-gathering and economy mini-game within the Discord bot. Key features include:

1. **Resource Collection**
   - 8 different resources with varying rarities and values
   - Stone (common), Coal, Iron, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Emerald, Ruby (rare)
   - Random chance-based mining with equipment multipliers
   - Cooldown system with prestige-based reductions

2. **Equipment Progression**
   - 8 tiers of pickaxes with increasing multipliers
   - Wooden (starter) to Obsidian (end-game)
   - Each upgrade provides greater mining efficiency
   - Progressive cost scaling for balanced progression

3. **Shop System**
   - Various utility items that enhance mining capabilities
   - Mining Helmet: Increases mining success rate
   - Mining Gloves: Increases resource amount
   - Resource Bag: Increases storage capacity
   - Energy Drink: Reduces mining cooldown
   - Metal Detector: Chance to find rare resources
   - Dynamite Pack: Chance to double resources

4. **Prestige System**
   - Reset progress in exchange for permanent bonuses
   - Each prestige level provides increased mining rewards
   - Progressive cooldown reduction with higher prestige
   - Increasing cost for each prestige level
   - Ownership of shop items persists through prestige

5. **Leaderboard**
   - Server-wide competition for top miners
   - Rankings based on total wealth and prestige level
   - Visual display of progress for motivation

The mining system integrates with the existing economy, providing an alternative method for earning coins through resource collection and sales, rather than relying solely on message activity or coin drops.

### Bot Status System

The bot status system allows administrators to manage the bot's operational state and inform users about its availability. The system includes three status types:

1. **Online**
   - The bot is fully operational
   - Default status indicator: 🟢
   - Bot presence is set to online

2. **Maintenance**
   - The bot is undergoing maintenance but is still responsive
   - Status indicator: 🟠
   - Bot presence is set to idle with "Maintenance Mode" activity

3. **Offline**
   - The bot is marked as offline (though commands may still work)
   - Status indicator: 🔴
   - Bot presence is set to do not disturb

Status changes are logged to a designated channel (configurable through the status panel) with time, reason, and who made the change. This allows server members to stay informed about the bot's status and any planned maintenance or downtime.

### Unified Drop Management

The drop management system allows administrators to control both XP and coin drops from a single interface:

- View real-time status of both systems simultaneously
- Configure settings for both systems in one place
- Activate/deactivate each system independently
- See detailed configuration information
- Get visual indicators of active state and setup status

This streamlined approach reduces the need to use multiple separate commands to manage the drop systems, making administration more efficient.

### Coin Drops

Coin drops are scheduled events where a message appears in a designated channel. Users can react to the message for a chance to win coins. Only one user (chosen randomly from those who reacted) will receive the coins.

Configuration options:
- Channel: Where drops will appear
- Min/Max Coins: Range of random coin amounts
- Interval: How often drops occur (minutes, hours, or days)

### XP Drops

Similar to coin drops, XP drops allow users to gain XP by reacting to messages that appear in a designated channel.

Configuration options:
- Channel: Where drops will appear
- Min/Max XP: Range of random XP amounts
- Interval: How often drops occur (minutes, hours, or days)

   - Maintenance can only be performed when levels drop to 50% or below
   - Businesses with low maintenance generate less income
   - At 0% maintenance, businesses become inactive until repaired

3. **Income Collection**
   - Income accumulates hourly based on business type and maintenance level
   - Users can collect income at any time
   - Income is added directly to the user's coin balance

4. **Risk Events**
   - Random events can occur based on business risk level
   - Events may reduce maintenance levels or cause temporary loss of income
   - Higher risk businesses offer better income but face more frequent events

5. **Admin Management Commands**
   - `/reset_properties`: Reset accumulated income for all users' properties (Admin only)
   - `/edit_property`: Edit an existing property's parameters (price, income, maintenance cost, etc.) (Admin only)

     - `tournament_votes.json` for game vote data
     - `tickets.json` for ticket system configuration
     - `giveaways.json` for giveaway data
  3. Bot will copy these files to the appropriate locations
- Note: This complements the database restore by importing other data files

#### PostgreSQL Database Migration

- Command: `/pgmigrate`
- Description: Migrates all user data from SQLite to PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Usage: Use to enable data persistence across different hosting platforms
- Process:
  1. Set up a PostgreSQL database and add the DATABASE_URL to your .env file
  2. Run the `/pgmigrate` command as an administrator

  - User count in the database
- Note: If PostgreSQL is configured but not being used, the command will recommend running the migration
- Security: Only administrators can use this command

For detailed information about PostgreSQL migration, see the `POSTGRES_MIGRATION.md` file.

### Cross-Host Data Migration Guide

If you need to move the bot between hosting environments (e.g., from UptimeRobot to Replit), follow these steps:

1. **Backup data from the source environment:**
   - Run `/dbsync` to receive database files in your DMs
   - Save all files to your local computer

2. **Prepare the destination environment:**
   - Ensure the bot is set up with the same token and basic configuration
   - Start the bot to initialize the database with default values

3. **Restore the database:**
   - Run `/dbrestore` in the destination environment
   - Upload the `leveling.db` file when prompted
   - Wait for the bot to restart after the restore completes

4. **Import JSON data:**
   - Run `/dbimportjson` in the destination environment
   - Upload any JSON files you received from the backup
   - Wait for the bot to restart after the import completes

5. **Verify the migration:**
   - Test basic commands like `/rank` or `/mine` to confirm user data is present
   - Check investments, tournaments, and other systems for proper functionality
   - Verify existing tournaments are accessible via the `/tournament` command

This process ensures all user progress, levels, coins, and other data are preserved when moving between hosting environments.

### Database Structure

The bot supports two database backends:

#### SQLite Database
The traditional database (`leveling.db`) used for backward compatibility.

#### PostgreSQL Database
A persistent database that allows data to be accessible across different hosting platforms. This is the recommended database for production use.

For detailed information about PostgreSQL migration, see the `POSTGRES_MIGRATION.md` file.

Both database backends contain the following tables:
- `users`: Stores user information including XP, level, prestige, and coins
- `settings`: Global settings for the leveling system
- `invites`: Tracking of user invites (real, fake, bonus, left)
- `mining_stats`: User mining statistics (money, prestige level, equipment)
- `mining_resources`: Resources gathered through mining
- `mining_items`: Items purchased to enhance mining
- `activity_events`: Records of activity events and their settings
- `activity_participants`: User participation data for activity events

The investments system stores data in a separate JSON file (`investments.json`), which contains:
- Business definitions (cost, income rates, risk levels)
- User-owned businesses
- Purchase timestamps
- Maintenance levels
- Income collection history

The tournament system stores data in separate JSON files:
- `tournaments.json`: Contains tournament definitions, participants, teams, brackets, and match results
- `tournament_votes.json`: Contains game vote data for selecting tournament games

### Tournament System
