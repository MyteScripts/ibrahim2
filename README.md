## Data Persistence and Cross-Host Migration

We offer two solutions for maintaining data when hosting your bot on different platforms:

### Option 1: PostgreSQL Database (Recommended)

The PostgreSQL solution provides seamless data persistence across platforms without manual migration.

#### PostgreSQL Commands

- `/pgmigrate`: Migrates all user data from SQLite to PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- `/pgstatus`: Shows the status of PostgreSQL configuration and migration

#### PostgreSQL Setup Process

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database on any hosting provider
2. Add the `DATABASE_URL` to your bot's environment variables
3. Run the `/pgmigrate` command to transfer existing data
4. The bot will automatically use PostgreSQL for all data operations

See `POSTGRES_MIGRATION.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Manual Database Backup and Restore

For environments without PostgreSQL, you can manually transfer data between hosts.

#### Manual Migration Commands

- `/dbsync`: Backs up all database and JSON files to the admin's DMs
- `/dbrestore`: Restores the database from a previously backed up file
- `/dbimportjson`: Imports JSON data files after a database restore

#### Manual Migration Process

1. In your source environment (e.g., Railway):
   - Run `/dbsync` to receive database backups in your DMs
   - Save these files to your computer

2. In your destination environment (e.g., Replit):
   - Ensure the bot is set up with the same token
   - Run `/dbrestore` and upload the database file
   - Run `/dbimportjson` and upload any JSON files
   
Both options ensure your user data, levels, coins, and other progress will be preserved!

See the `DOCUMENTATION.md` file for detailed instructions on database management and migration.
